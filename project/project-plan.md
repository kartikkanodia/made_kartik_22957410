# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Investigate the correlation between natural disasters and climate change.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. To what extent does climate change play a role in occurrence of Natural disasters?

## Description

Climate change influences the occurrence of natural disasters by altering weather patterns and environmental conditions. While it may not directly cause specific events, such as hurricanes or wildfires, it exacerbates their impacts and increases their likelihood. Understanding this relationship is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate risks and enhance resilience.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: Kaggle
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data
* Data Type: CSV

Short description of the DataSource.

### Datasource2: Kaggle
* Metadata URL: https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters
* Data Type: CSV

The dataset from Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study, covers global land and ocean temperatures from as early as 1750, with temperature averages and uncertainties provided. The dataset is neatly organized and allows for slicing into subsets by country. Additionally, it includes temperature data at the city, state, and country levels.
